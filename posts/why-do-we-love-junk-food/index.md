You asked us a question. "Why do we love junk food?"

A lot of money goes into making junk food. A lot of strategy goes into making junk good too. Effort also is a big part of making junk food.

The goal is to make it cheap. It needs to be easy. And even though it has little to no nutritional value it keeps you wanting more.

It is often high in things like salt and sugar. It also has a lot of fat. They start pleasure centers in our brains. Those make us feel oh-so-yummy-good. And they make us want to keep eating.

See, our brains are pretty big. They need a lot of energy to do their thing. So we evolved to love high-energy food.

Beyond the super high calorie count, junk food makers have a million tricks up their sleeves. That is when it comes to making us really want their products.

Like the melt-in-your-mouth quality that tricks us. We think the calories have magically floated away.

Or boosting flavor just short of what is called, "sensory specific satiety."  It is flavor that is really big. It overwhelms your brain. And you end up not wanting anymore.

We know that it is not good for us. Eating junk food it is linked with many health problems. Some of those are obesity and diabetes. Heart disease and even cancer are also linked to junk food. But even with those problems junk food can be really hard to resist.

你问了一个问题，为什么我们喜欢吃垃圾食品？

A lot of money goes into making junk food. A lot of strategy goes into making junk good too. Effort also is a big part of making junk food.

大量的资金进入制造垃圾。大量的市场战略同样进入制造垃圾食品领域。Effort 同样是制造垃圾食品的一大部分。

The goal is to make it cheap. It needs to be easy. And even though it has little to no nutritional value it keeps you wanting more.

目标是让它尽可能便宜，这很简单，尽管它有点不是很营养但就是催使让你吃更多

It is often high in things like salt and sugar. It also has a lot of fat. They start pleasure centers in our brains. Those make us feel oh-so-yummy-good. And they make us want to keep eating.

它富含盐和糖分，同样也富含脂肪。它启动了我们大脑中的快乐中枢。它让我们感觉到这尝试起来是非常棒的。并且它们促使我们不停的吃下去。

See, our brains are pretty big. They need a lot of energy to do their thing. So we evolved to love high-energy food.

Beyond the super high calorie count, junk food makers have a million tricks up their sleeves. That is when it comes to making us really want their products.

注意了吗？我们的大脑是相当大的，它需要非常多的能量去运转。所以我们形成热爱高能量的食物。在超高卡路里的一边，垃圾食品制作者们有成千上百的诡计。这就是我们真正想要它们的产品的时候。

Like the melt-in-your-mouth quality that tricks us. We think the calories have magically floated away.

就像那种入口即化的口感欺骗了我们。我们认为卡路里会奇迹般的飘走。

Or boosting flavor just short of what is called, "sensory specific satiety."  It is flavor that is really big. It overwhelms your brain. And you end up not wanting anymore.

或者提高味道，而不是达到所谓的“感觉特别饱腹感”。味道才是最重要的，他让你的大脑不知所措，然后你就不在想要了。

We know that it is not good for us. Eating junk food it is linked with many health problems. Some of those are obesity and diabetes. Heart disease and even cancer are also linked to junk food. But even with those problems junk food can be really hard to resist.

我们知道它对于我们不健康。吃垃圾食品会引起多种健康问题。一些例如肥胖症或者是糖尿病。垃圾食品同样联系着心脏病甚至癌症。即使垃圾食品伴随这些问题，你依然很难去抵制。
